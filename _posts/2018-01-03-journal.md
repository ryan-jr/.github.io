but is really strange in my mental model trying to separate out decimal and floats, since I played around with it a bit and it "doesn't support floats", but after reading the docs I figured out that floats/decimals are represented differently internally.

### 2018-01-03 17:35, Oh, and to figure out how to calculate pi to 30 digits, I had to use this formula: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula which took some time to decipher/figure out.

### 2018-01-03 17:44, Ahhhh, I see.  
I just ran the pi to N digits function without decimal and it gets cut off after 14 digits.  Decimal really IS useful
