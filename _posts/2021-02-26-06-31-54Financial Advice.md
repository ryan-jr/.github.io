Today I came across an interesting PBS [VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdUKhgW1gOo) on financial advice that boils down to Save 10-20% of income, pay off credit card debt in full every month, invest in mutual funds/don't try to pick stocks, max out your 401k, get high deductible insurance, promote social insurance/programs.
