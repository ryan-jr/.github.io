# The Kali Struggle 
So about noon today I picked up a new machine fully wanting to install Kali Linux on it since I've gotten more and more into NETSEC and that has generally been the recommended OS.  So the first thing I do after getting home with the new laptop is download and boot to a live version of Kali.  I install it and it asks me to dual boot with Windows, it says "Windows 7" in the graphical install, but whatever.  

Well it turns out that the GRUB bootloader doesn't recognize/play well with windows 10 and would only recognize/run Kali.  Kali also did not install WLAN drivers, so I was pretty stuck in trying to troubleshoot things.  After about 4-5 hours of trying to fix the bootloader and downloading network drivers I switched the BIOS to boot to windows and downloaded and installed Ubuntu which is has been working fine for the past few hours.  

So that's been my day.
