So I've got a coding project at work, and things are...interesting.  I'm the only person working on the coding project which is a mix of jQuery, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript all of which has few comments, and there is NO documentation to speak of anywhere(well at least until I started implementing some).  

I was frustrated with the person who had the project before me until I realized how the company attempted to roll out features which is by emailing the developer what they want by the end of the day leaving no time for effective research, development, testing, etc... let alone commenting/helping others. 

There are a lot of other issues with the project, but I have a LOT more empathy for the original developer now.
