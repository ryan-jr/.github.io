So lately I've been getting back into [CodeFights](https://codefights.com) which is a great way to practice for problems that I wouldn't neccessarily think of or expect.  So far in the Arcade (the section where I've spent the most time) I have had to:

* Return the sum of 2 digits
* Convert time, return the sum of the digits of said time
* Find the largest number that is less than or equal to a boundry number, given a boundry and a divisor, that is a factor of the boundry number and a multiple of the divisor
* Find the number of people occupying a theatre (assuming all seats are filled) from a given position, given columns, rows, and seats
* Figure out the number of widgets each person can get if they can get no more than any other person, given the number of people and number of widgets
* Figured out the largest number that can be created given the number of digits in that number.  
* Implemented an RPG leveling verification system

And all have these have just been the first stage/world.  Needless to say its been fun streching my brain and figuring stuff out.  I've also been working on a hangman game for The Odin Project, because it seems like an interesting way to combine skills and make things work.  

One of the problems I ran into when I was coding it up last night is that I realized that my CSV file didn't properly separate everything which took longer than I thought it would to figure out, but I'm making progress so I'm happy.  

Looking through so far the biggest things I need to work on in terms of syntax is/are still (Ruby) Hashes and understanding the nuance of Classes, modules, and Mixins.  I suspect that I will have to force myself to start using them in order to be more comfortable with them.
