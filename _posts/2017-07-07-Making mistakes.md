It sounds strange, but having a job where you can make mistakes is nice.  Although I still get pretty back flashbacks whenever I make a mistake, and get it pointed out due to previous jobs, having a job where mistakes are constructively approached and discussed is really nice.  

As time has gone on as well, having relationships change is hard too.  Especially friendships, finding a set of deep and meaningful friendships at this point is difficult, and there's seemingly no good way to resolve that.  

In other news I came across a post from [Kent Beck](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/mastering-programming/1184427814923414) (of extreme programming fame) this morning on HN, and there are some common patterns I notice that have consistently been repeated elsewhere:

1.  Slicing/breaking things down
2.  Taking one thing at a time 
3.  Call the shot/predict what the code will do


There are some less obvious things as well:
1.  80/15/5.  Ususally I've heard this as the 80/20 rule which is more clear cut, but Beck's method makes sense too.
2.  Symetry, this one I'm going to have to spend time thinking about, but it makes sense logically rearding program/responsibility division.
