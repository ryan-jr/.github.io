I'm now realizing more and more, why project management is important.  Timelines/deadlines.  There was a good thread on [r/programmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/89ngjd/stack_overflows_2018_developer_survey_reveals/) analyzing the Stack Overflow dev survey and what it mean for overtime/time management.  

With this project I'm on now, it's crunch time all the time, and that leads to burnout and frustration because it leaves NO time for testing or anything else, which just leads to a shoddy product.  

Anyway some great links I found are about the [state of backend in 2018](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/modern-backend-developer-in-2018-6b3f7b5f8b9), [the state of frontend in 2018](https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/modern-frontend-developer-in-2018-4c2072fa2b9c), and [JS/frontend testing](https://medium.com/welldone-software/an-overview-of-javascript-testing-in-2018-f68950900bc3)
