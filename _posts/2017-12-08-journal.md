### 2017-12-08 03:30, So after fixing all the stuff with Mooc.fis Java class Im ready to get to work on it.  
ECHO is off.
### 2017-12-08 07:04, I'm a little frustrated that the Mooc.fi on Java in the classes section, covers state but doesn't mention behavior despite the fact that they have/teach class methods...it's weird.  
They teach OOP but not neccessarily all of the vocabulary that one needs for it. 
ECHO is off.
### 2017-12-08 14:11, I was able to work out a couple more PE problems during some downtime, and it's fun and challenging having to figure everything out.  
I'm well on my way to 25 problems, but I know there will certainly be some curveballs sent my way.  Oh well, all part of the process. 
ECHO is off.
### 2017-12-08 19:13, After reading the paper that initally proposed bitcoin (which is surprisingly small at 9 pages)(https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) 2 things stand out to me.  
1:  The distributed model comes with its own set of challenges(see Tor, also the number of bitcoin thefts, etc...) and 2: They claim to propose a system for electronic transactions that doesn't rely on trust, but that is demonstrably false at the point of multiple nodes, systems, and cryptographic algorithims rely on some level of trust. 
ECHO is off.
### 2017-12-08 22:50, After debugging with Mooc.fi for an hour I found that I was missing this.variableName in the constructor resulting in an error, found it, fixed it, finished the assignment.  
Yay 
ECHO is off.
