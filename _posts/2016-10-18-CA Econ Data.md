# Fun Times With Economic Data!
So I was thinking about various side projects/invstigations that I could pursue and I came across an interesting article from [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2014/08/21/how-far-100-goes-in-each-state-and-major-metropolitan-area/#33a845596283) which relied on data from [The Tax Foundation](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/real-value-100-each-state-2016) on how far 100$ would go in each state.  

Now that in and of itself is interesting data, however, that doesn't neccessarily tell us anything we don't already know especially since it is broken down by state, which can have wildly different drivers/factors of cost depending on where you're at.  Luckily the Tax Foundation also has a map that breaks the costs down by major metropolitan area (in this case major area is defined as those areas with more than 100,000 people).  

While this is all well and good I wanted to drill deeper into the data, and luckily the Tax Foundation provides access to their data sets from 2014 and before.  I ran the data for all major metropolitan areas in CA in 2014 and came out with some interesting findings:

* The upper limit on how far people seem to be willing to travel/regularly commute to a major metropolitan area is ~1.5 hours.  I'm basing this conclusion off of my personal experience of being from Modesto, but people still use public transporation (MAX to BART) to get to jobs in the city. 

* The cheapest metropolitan area to live in by a WIDE margin is El Centro in the Imperial valley, which is ~2 hours outside of San Diego, and is well below both the average and median living costs of metropolitan areas of California.  

* If you run a regression on the data, we find that (not terribly surprisingly) that rents are driving costs in major metropolitan areas, which given how much of an outlier the San Jose/Sunnvale area is, would suggest that there should be a policy of increased housing supply to decrease overall costs.
