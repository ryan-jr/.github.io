I've been having fun and practicing lately with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) which has been a ton of fun and learning.  Furthermore, I found a super cool [talk](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/adventofcode/) from FOSDEM 2021 by its creator Topaz/Eric Wastl which was a great listen with tons of behind the scenes info of AoC and thoughts on accessiblity, puzzles, and coding in general.
