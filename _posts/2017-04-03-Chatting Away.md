So one of the things that I've wanted to do for a while is build a chat app.  Luckily I found a guide online, when I came across a new JS framework(shocker there) of [Mithril.js](https://github.com/lhorie/mithril.js/wiki/Tutorials-&-Videos-&-Slides).  Now I started to go through and follow along with a youtube [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pzqxla9u1s), but unfortunatley it broke after working with it for a bit...sooooo I went back to basics and straight to the source at [socket.io](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/) to get things to work.  

This taught me a couple of important lessons, or rather reinforced some key lessons:

1.  Start small/MVP, and KISS, because more complex means more things can break.  

2.  Test along the way/after each step/module/method/new feature.  

Those two, along with planning/research seem to be a big part of programming for me.  

Another really cool article I came across was on writing your own [language](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919).  That's something that I'd like to work up to, but will probably put on the back burner for now.
