# Tweets

While reading through my usual news feed of tweets including 538, the CA Department of Water Resources, among others.  I saw that [Free Code Camp](https://twitter.com/freecodecamp?lang=en) was tweeting out some awesome success stories and contributors including [Coding Lawyer](http://codinglawyer.blogspot.com/) as well as [Kelly Lougheed](http://www.kellylougheed.com/).  Not only do I really love the coding community(especially Saron of [CodeNewbies](http://www.codenewbie.org/) and Ruby Book Club fame), but also the resources that are available (because it's not like I don't already post a TON of links to resources on my blog), and the support/positive feedback loops that the whole community provides.

# Twitch

One of the other resources that I came across that I found through Free Code Camp's retweet of Kelly's [status](https://twitter.com/kellylougheed/status/767457709784379392) directed me to Twitch.tv for programming.  I've tried to keep up with [livecoding](https://www.livecoding.tv/), but my general experience has been that it's all over the place in terms of skill levels and approachability/accessibility so I'm very happy that I found the twitch channels that I did.  Doing a quick look around I found the following

*[Free Code Camp (YAY!)](https://www.twitch.tv/freecodecamp/profile)

*[Noobs2Ninjas](https://www.twitch.tv/noobs2ninjas)

*[General Programming Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creative/programming)

*[Programming, with a focus on game development](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creative/gamedev)

Overall, some really good stuff that I'm happy that I found.
