# Achievement Unlocked

So I was wanting to do something else productive with the Linux/Ubuntu install that I have, and was going through and reinstalling everything when I noticed that railsbridge had a 'Deploy app to Heroku' section.

Sure enough I decided to follow instructions and uploaded/deployed my first (simple) app earlier tonight that can be found [here](https://dry-sands-16951.herokuapp.com/).  I'm super happy right now to be at this point and I can only keep growing from here.
