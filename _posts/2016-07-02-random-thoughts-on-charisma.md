So tonight I was lucky enough to run across some people who are well versed in the debate space, how it operates, and what it is, and I have to say it was one of the more educational nights that I have had outside of school/a formal education system.  It taught me things like how not to give a fuck, that social interaction/engagement relies on magic and misdirection, social cues/understandings are important, and that I have far more worth than what I think.  Don't fear engaging others, you might be rejected a lot, but it's worth it in the end.  Just do you, have charisma, be friendly and outgoing, and you'll be fine, notice something about them and talk about it be it clothes, what they're watching, drinking, doing, whatever, just go for it.
