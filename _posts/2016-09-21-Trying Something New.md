Ok, so I'm thinking that something that I'm going to try is upload a video a week or so to Youtube.  Mostly this will be focused on working through books, or some aspect of programming that I find interesting/want to learn more about via screencasting.  

I have [Open Broadcater Software](https://obsproject.com/) installed and the audio set up and working from it, but now i'm figuring out the Youtube channel etc... So that first hello world video should come in a few days.  

## Learning 

So lately I've been learning, or rather its been reinforced to me how prescient Quncy's [Hacking Time](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/i-hack-time-6d3a32193c9#.3bb2ps3k5) article has been.  I'm also still learning how to properly make a pull request, I've found some repos that I want to contribute to, but I'm not ready to make my first pull request yet because I don't know how (lol).  This is something I need to find on Youtube...
