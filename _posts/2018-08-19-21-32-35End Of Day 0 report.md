# End Of Day 0 Report

So today I studied for Intro to IT and made it about 3/4s of the way through the study guide for Network Foundations.

It's looking like my program mentor will change, which will be an interesting adjustment so we'll see how that goes.  I'm still compiling study resources for all of the courses but this prep should help save time in the long run.

I think the approach that I want to take is:

1.  Study the course material to get a sense of it
2.  Take the Pre-Assessment
3.  Use the Pre-Assessment to understand areas where I need improvement.
4.  Study weak areas
5.  Take the Objective Assessment

* NOTE: The above does not apply in/to courses where it's reported that the PA/OA differ.
