## Github Contributions
So one of the biggest hesitations that I have is in regards to contributing to open source repos on github.  This hesitation/fear largely exists because I fear that I will screw up in some way.  Luckily there was an r/learnprogramming post dealing with that [exact issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4xts2c/how_do_i_get_skilled_enough_to_work_on_open/).  From there there were a couple of VERY good guides from [github](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) and [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-identifying-how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).  It's times like these that I'm happy that the developer community is so giving.  

## Awesome Interview Stuff
I also came across some GREAT interview tips and job boards as well from hacker news.  [This](http://blog.robertelder.org/50-interviews-with-facebook-twitter-amazon-others/) piece is pure gold.  It covers everything from how the interview works to what to expect, and best practices/things to know.  It's pretty awesome.
