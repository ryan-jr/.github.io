OK, so I did another hackathon and this one went a ton better.  For this project we did a quick VR project in 12 hours that was pretty cool and I got some inspiration for other stuff I want to work on too.  I loved the people I worked with as well they were all pretty chill and knowledgable, and even though I didn't always know what to do, it was pretty easy to fit in and find a niche, even with 4 other people.
