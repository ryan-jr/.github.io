So one of the tough things about trying to get experience is trying to find decent/solid open source projects to contribute to.  Luckily free code camp has a nice set of projects to contribute to with [Open Source for Good](https://www.freecodecamp.org/nonprofits/) which is a directory of repos that have issue/feature requests that you can contribute to which is super awesome with a ton of cool projects as well, which is even better.
