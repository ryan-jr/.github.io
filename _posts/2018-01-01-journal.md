### 2018-01-01 11:33, Holy crap it's hard to find a good cutoff to assign a sentence a score that makes it "interesting", increasing/decreasing the score by 1 can either decrease the returned number of sentences by 75% or increase it drastically.  
ECHO is off.
### 2018-01-01 16:37, Ok, so right now I have a pretty good summarizer in that it will summarize an article down to 3 sentnences, I modified the original algo that I had away from the mean and centered around the score itself.  
The challenge is how to maintain chronolgoical order AND score order... 
ECHO is off.
### 2018-01-01 16:55, I opted to create a function that takes in the strings with the largest scores, and a list of all of the strings in the text.  
From there I find the index of the 3 highest scoring sentences and sort those indexes.  I then loop through the list with all the sentences printing out where the indexes match. 
ECHO is off.
