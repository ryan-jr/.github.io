Today has mostly been spent figuring out rails and some other stuff, but mostly rails.  As a framework with so many interwoven parts (even though MVC does make sense as a set of interrelated parts), it can be confusing to keep track of for now.  Oh well, back to the grind.  


Learning materials for today:
# Humdle Hacker Bundle 
The Joy of Coding Bundle from the other day on HumbleBundle.com was wonderful, but I also found out about some of the books from this one as well, and they come fairly well recommended.  [This](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3061931/security/the-humble-hacker-s-book-bundle.html) from computer world does a solid job explaining what's in it, but I can speak from experience that Automate the Boring Stuff and No Starch Press as a publishing house is really good.  

# Learning Git
So after Egghead.io's course on how to contribute to an open source project, I was still confused and wanted more practice with Git.  Luckily the WebDev community has TONS of resources that I was able to find pretty quickly:

* [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git/performance)

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/37zgzt/the_very_basic_guide_to_git_and_github_for/)

* [js.org](http://learngitbranching.js.org/)

* [github](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
