Ok, so one of the thing I've learned over these last few months/year is time/project mangagment/project focus on an individual level.  I've usually found that what works for me is a straightforward linear process of learning via video and projects.  This is also in conjuction with doing no more than 3 projects at a time.  I also know that I'm not the only one that suffers from project hopping because I've seen multiple reddit posts about it as well as a stackoverflow post or two.
