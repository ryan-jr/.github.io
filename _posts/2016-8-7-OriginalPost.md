#Getting There

Finally got to a point where I could set up a github pages account properly.  I had been working on it throughout last night and today using the github pages FAQs and info [https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/][1].  While that was useful it was also slightly confusing in some ways especially when it came to creating a gemfile and storing/updating files locally.  


Luckily coming back to the project today, I stumbled across [Creating a Blog with Jekyll](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), which was far easier to understand and follow along, and I feel MUCH more comfortable with it.  [This Markdown Cheatsheet from Adam p has also been extrodinarily helpful](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
