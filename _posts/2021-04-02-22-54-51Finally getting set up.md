Finally got set up with a VM after a boot/CPU scare.   It was easier than I expected and now I'm finally getting the tooling I want on to the machine.  I think my first order of business for analysis is looking at old malware and analyzing it.  

Tools so far:

- PeStudio
- Process Hacker
- ProcMon
- ProcDot
- AutoRuns
- Wireshark
- x64DbG
- Ghidra
- Radare
