### 2017-12-30 08:33, OK, after research I decided to use scrapy for my project...scrapy doesn't want to install because it hangs on the twisted module/fails.  
Had to download the win_amd64 twisted module from here https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#twisted and point pip install to the DL location on my C drive.
