So I've been trying for the last day or so to figure out inheritance/classes in Java and I hit some weird roadblocks including thinking that I could declare the same variables in the superclass and the subclass.  I learned about variable shadowing there, In my googling I also learned about different types of inheritance in Java (Single, Multilevel, and Hierarchal).  I also learned how to use the super method more effectively and how to better implement methods.  After wrapping y head around it I feel like I have a better idea of what inheritance is and generally how it's supposed to work.  A lot of links out there also have too much word salad and unneccessary language/description that are far easier emphasized with a graphic.  Some good links I found that are pretty straightforward are from [Informit](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1021579), [Javapoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/inheritance-in-java), [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_inheritance.htm).
