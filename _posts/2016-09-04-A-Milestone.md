This morning at around 2AM I finally completed the first section of The Odin Project: Web Development 101.  Looking back at my commit history it took me months to actually end up getting here, which is FAR longer than I expected, but given the detours I took I'm not surprised.  I'm just looking forward to learning more.  

# Awesome Things

Reading through ToP I came across some awesome posts and learning materials.  
First up is Thoughbot with their [Playbook](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook) Which is beautiful in and of itself, but the detail it goes into is astonishing, especially with hiring and best [practices](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/our-company/hiring), and their style guide on github is to die [for](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style).  They even have an awesome series of [podcasts](https://thoughtbot.com/learn#podcasts).  I'm certainly a fan of [Bikeshed](http://bikeshed.fm/)


The other stuff that I came across that I'm loving right now is [The Principles of Web Development]( https://www.42lines.net/2011/10/13/some-principles-of-web-development/) which are funny but practical.  and the [Principles of Good Programming](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=331531) which a quick, clear, and easy to understand.  I love it.
