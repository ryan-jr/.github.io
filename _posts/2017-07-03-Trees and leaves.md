So yesterday/the day before I learned about algos and trees.  To be honest, most of the sorts and searches make sense in terms of time complexity, although insertion sort is still a weird one to me.  I'm a big fan of high level overview that then get down into details/implementation/psuedocode much like [this set of posts by Vaidehi Joshi](https://dev.to/vaidehijoshi) which cover a bunch of different sorts and CS concepts at a very high level.  Overall, the concepts/high levels generally make sense, implementation is the tricky part(kind of like Radix sorts).
