### 2018-01-14 21:37, Ok, I ust learned about extend which has some advantages over append.  
Extend writes the elements of the list, whereas append tries to tries to write the list itself in a situation in which you are attempting to add a list to an existing list.  (e.g. >>>newList = [], >>>newList.append([1, 2]) # [[1, 2]], >>>newList.extend([1, 2]) # [1, 2] 
ECHO is off.
