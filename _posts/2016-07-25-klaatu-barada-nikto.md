<strong>Another Day Another Rails App
</strong>I'm happy that I was able to build another Rails app today, and this one is completely different from the bookmark index that I was able to build.  Much like the first one though, this one came with struggles too, but took significantly less time (only about 3 hours to build, so that's progress I guess(?) but there's still room for improvement.

For those who may not know Mackenzie Child (found here: https://mackenziechild.me/intro-to-rails/ ) has a set of really awesome series and learning resources.  I stumbled across him as I was doing research on Ruby, Rails, programming, and other stuff in general.  Initially what intrigued me was the 12 Apps in 12 Weeks challenge he had himself doing in order to learn/improve, and I was happy to see he had other stuff on his Youtube account as well ( https://www.youtube.com/user/mackenziechild/ ).

One of the playlists that is on there is 'Intro to Rails' which is about an hour long, and walks through the basic constructs and concepts of rails at a nice overview level.  In this you build a simple blog/content management system.

&nbsp;

I followed along with the video earlier today, up until the point I didn't and got lost (I didn't properly put resources :posts in the route file).  Trying to troubleshoot the single routes.rb issue that I created is honestly ate up most of my time.  I spent an hour before work trying to fix it, and then came back after work and tried to fix it until I blew everything away and started all over again, watching the videos from the beginning.  I consulted a number of stack overflow posts, etc... but I was never getting any different error messages/seemingly making any progress which is what convinced me to start from scratch.

Starting from scratch again though was the right decision, as I was able to put up everything in a little less than an hour while taking some notes along the way.  Some of the results of my effort are showcased below.  Simple, but getting better/more consistent, so I'm happy.
