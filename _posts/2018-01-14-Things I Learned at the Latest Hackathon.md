1.  Always work with a team if you can, going it alone is putting to much on yourself.  

2.  Two monitors (at least), are (usually) better than one. 

3.  PLANNING IS KEY!!!

4.  Know your tools, know what they can do, and know what they can't do.  

5.  Have an MVP in mind and know what your core ideas/concept is.  

6.  Be sure to talk to people, network, and authentically engage others don't just try and get a business card out of it.
