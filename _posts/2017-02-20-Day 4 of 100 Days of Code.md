Today I primarily got further in Khan Academy's Algorithims course working to understand Asymptotic Notation and also understanding selection sort.  I know that I'll have to consistently review notation in order to understand it, also the language that KA used to try and communicate notation was fairly opaque despite attempting to use graphics/graphs which made it much harder to understand...this is why scientific communication is a thing, because if you want to educate people you need to use a common language.  The common language lesson is one that I'm learning over and over as I go through life.
