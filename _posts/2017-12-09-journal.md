### 2017-12-09 10:59, Selection sort makes sense now, and the speed/time tradeoffs for arrays and linked lists do too.  
It's times like this that I wish Python was more clear about the distinction between arrays/lists.  The differences are there (largely in declaration/implementation and methods that can be called on them), but the language is muddled enough that it can be confusing. 
ECHO is off.
### 2017-12-09 12:43, I'm finding that I like Spyder more than PyCharm right now, both are good tools but it's just a preference that could easily change.  
I'm brute forcing my way through Tic Tac Toe, and I'm sure there's a better way, but I'll have to go back and refactor it. 
ECHO is off.
### 2017-12-09 17:11, I made tic tac toe, which ended up taking me about 3 hours or so.  
This first version is a bruteforce with a lot of if/elif statements, I need to go through and refactor. 
ECHO is off.
### 2017-12-09 21:22, I'm reading Google's Python style guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and I'm finding things that I'm already going to start integrating (paren rules, and docstring rules for a start), they are super awesome and should make for better code.
