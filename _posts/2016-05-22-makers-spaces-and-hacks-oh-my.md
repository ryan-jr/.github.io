While I was out seeing a movie with friends tonight I had an opportunity to stumble on/into a hackathon.  A few of my friends had attended ones at UCI, UCSD, and LAHacks, but this one was much smaller and more subdued.  There were 4 teams present that were working on projects for the community and local non profits.  It was really cool to watch everything come together and see what kind of things people came up with and how they worked together in teams.  Getting to see members of the community include everyone from beginning designers, high schoolers, to more experienced coders was a real treat to experience.  I would really recommend anyone who is into code at all to attend one for fun, learning, and to meet new people.
