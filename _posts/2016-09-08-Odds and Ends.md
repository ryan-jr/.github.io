I've been wanting to make this post for a while now, but it covers some fun stuff that I've found from around the internet.  

The first one is several posts from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/vhccu/how_do_you_know_when_you_know_a_language/) which cover(s) the topic of when someone 'knows' a language which is something I've been thinking about for a bit now, since I'm getting further and further into Python and Ruby along with a smattering of other languages.  There are other posts from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/iea3f/what_do_people_mean_when_they_put_down_that_they/) that cover the [same topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/iea3f/what_do_people_mean_when_they_put_down_that_they/) as well.  At this point I would say that I am familiar with the languages and could look up and implement a solution and know what it does/how it operates and feel comfortable saying [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/s4n5o/when_am_i_fluent_enough_in_a_programming_language/), and [one more](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1nf8yd/when_do_you_feel_you_can_say_that_you_know_a/) for good measure.  


The topic area that I've been interested in is trying to find different open source projects to contribute to which was a tangential topic of conversation on Talk Python to Me the other day which covered Zolando which is a European fashion house/distributor.  Needless to say they have a pretty [amazing](http://zalando.github.io/#repositories?language=Python) repo.  This also touches on something that Quincy Larson posted about the other day in regards to contributing to open source [communities](https://medium.com/@quincylarson/i-read-this-article-a-few-days-ago-and-enjoyed-learning-about-shubhekshas-journey-into-open-source-c7fbad443612#.vteh3p4v4) TL;DR: Be open and accepting, like [Free Code Camp is](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md).  

The next set of stuff is larger stuff in regards to water policy and social policy, but it's still fun.  [Harvard Business School](https://hbr.org/2016/09/excess-management-is-costing-the-us-3-trillion-per-year) finds that overmanagment is a 3 trillion dollar problem in the US.  While [Scientific American](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/america-s-water-supply-the-corrosion-of-a-proud-tradition/#) argues that we need to invest more in water infrastructure (yay!).  While [Casually Explained](http://digg.com/video/body-language-casually-explained?utm_source=digg&utm_medium=twitter) explains and demystifies nonverbal communication/body language (NSFW Language).
