So I decided to throw together a quick dice rolling app tonight to 1.  Make sure I could still code somewhat well, and 2.  Try out something different/fun.  It's a quick project that's on the r/python learning page and I wanted to try it out in Java.  It's not bad.  I think I'll probably do hangman next, because that's more challening with dictionaries, file usage, etc...
