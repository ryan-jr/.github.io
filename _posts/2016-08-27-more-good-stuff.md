I'm SUPER happy that I've found some more really good stuff/advice as of late, because I was feeling pretty lost in the process of applying to places and figuring stuff out.  There is an AMAZINGLY good talk/google hangout from [Viking Code School](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/greg-kamradt-senior-growth-analyst-hacking-the-job-search-process?mc_cid=e85dd96290&mc_eid=1de4a643d0)(Full disclosure: ToP is from Viking Code School).  This talk though is worth its weight in gold in how Greg breaks down the numbers and how to get hired.  A+ would recommend.  

I also came across [DevWars] on YouTube(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKGFQsRvP5ijjwQgqRQirA/feed) which is an amazingly fun to watch effort of two teams trying to code against each other.  I found all of this through [Syntag on Twitch TV](https://www.twitch.tv/syntag)

I'm also really happy I came across Peter Cottle's website, or more specifically their [Resume](http://pcottle.github.io/PeterMCottle.com/).  I think it really provides a model for me on what a resume should look like.
