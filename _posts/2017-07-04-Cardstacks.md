Ok, so with my day off today I wanted to create a prototype flash card generator, so far it's coming along OK, and has most of the features that I want.  One of the things I struggled with when creating it was that I didn't follow the IS-A rule and tried to make cards an extension of the Cardstack class when really they should be separated, which created a stackoverflow error.  So far I've created what I want, and now I'm just working on the editing/deleting part of the idea.
