Over the past weeek or so I've found some useful links:

* [Algorithims post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/66kqd0/can_i_get_feedback_on_new_format_for_the_lets/)

* [Competitive algorithims post on YCombinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14115826)

* [Essential tools post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/66gjvs/besides_the_programming_language_learn_the/)

* [Explaing the difference between RESTful APIs and SOAP](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/66np0z/what_exactly_is_a_restful_api/)

* [Learning a computer programming language efficently](http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/learn-programming-languages-efficiently/)



I think all of these cover different aspects/neccessary parts of learning a language.  In the last couple of weeks or so I've been focusing primarily
in Java with forays into other languages, but I think for now I want to focus on Java.
