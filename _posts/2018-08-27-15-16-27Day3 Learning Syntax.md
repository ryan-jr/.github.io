Ok, so the last day or so I've been diving in through tutorial videos and stack overflow posts for C++ syntax since it's in one of the upcoming class, and it's not bad, but pointers aren't really fun.  

The other thing I've been getting into is the Student Starcraft (Broodwar) AI Tournament (SSCAIT), and doing some reading/research into it, especially Berkeley's Overmind AI which had some really cool and unique features.
