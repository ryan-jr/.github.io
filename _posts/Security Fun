So I found [this](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/20/04/09/208256/5g-virus-conspiracy-theory-fueled-by-coordinated-effort) article regarding an active disinformation campaign extremely interesting.  I think it's interesting for a few reasons in that it shows that disinformation is constant thing being played out, how disinformation is disseminated in a modern media ecosystem and potential reasons for why something like that would be happening now.  I can think of a few off of the top of my head.  

1.  Testing disinformation capabilities.  

2.  Continued destabilization/erosion of trust in institutions/media.  

3.  Finding new inroads/lines of argument for disinformation.  

Or some combination of all of the above (or more).  I'm also curious in seeing the dichotimies between organic conspiracy theories versus disinformation campaigns, and is definitely a distinction I want to research more.
