Malware analysis/RE is always fun from CTFs to just random stuff found on the internet [like farming bots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irhcfHBkfe0) While I've worked with some IDA in the past, I'm getting into Ghidra with The Ghidra Book/Definitive Guide to Ghidra to have a more robust toolset when it comes to RE.  I'm getting back into RE/malware analysis because development is fun, but RE feels like more of a chess game/challenge to figure out.  So far I'm going through the general static analysis stuff, have a lab/dynamic analysis environment set up, and am going back over some of the basics with Sam Bowne's classes.
