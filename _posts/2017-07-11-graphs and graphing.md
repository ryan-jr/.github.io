Ok, so after having watched the lecture a time or two graphs and traversing graphs makes sense.  I'd still like to see a step by step implementaiton of a tree and a tree rotation, but trees certainly seem more intutive and a good way to reduce a search space.  Other than that I've been making slow but steady progress on getting through what I want to accomplish, but the game is still about setting timelines and making sure to hit them as well as possible.
