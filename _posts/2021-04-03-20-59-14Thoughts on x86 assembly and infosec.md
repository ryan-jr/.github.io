So in working more with Sam Bowne's CCSF classes, I definitely need to get better with assembly which should be a fun challenge.  Additionally I watched an infosec panel this evening and infosec seems to suffer from the same issues that the software development/engineering field does, whicch is pipeline problems and getting into the industry.  Usually the advice on how to solve the two issues comes down to 1.  Do work for free to display "passion" and 2.  "be passionate".  I take issue with both of those, because as the art community puts it "exposure doesn't pay the bills", so the question is, why do work for free/be passionate, when it's entirely possible (though admittedly harder) to go through the route to the industry where you don't have to do that?
