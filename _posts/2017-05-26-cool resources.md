So today while I was programming bubble sort form memory, I realized I wanted a visualization of it so it could better connect/solidify for me.  Lo and behold there is such an awesome [website](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting?slide=1) that has a TON of cool visualizations, explanations, and psuedocode.  While the Wiki pages on a bunch of these sorting algos are great and go more in depth, I'm really a fan of this presentation style.
