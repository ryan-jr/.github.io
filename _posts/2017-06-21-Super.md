Ok so for a while I was struggling to figure out what super was in terms of constructors and how to use it, even with the [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4090834/when-do-i-use-super) because the top voted example seems to be pretty thin.   Basically it seems like we use super to pass in arguments FROM a subclass and then add on any specific fields that we need to.  

If we have a field that we want to set/update that is part of the superclass, then we would use a setter in that instance rather than trying to use a field/variable of the same name as I was trying to do before.  


```Java

// VEHICLE CLASS

public class Vehicle {
	
	private String type;
	private String name;
	private int topSpeed;
	private int wheels;
	
	public Vehicle() {
		
		this.type = "Unknown";
		this.name = "Unknown";
		this.topSpeed = 9999;
		this.wheels = 0;
	}
	
	public Vehicle(String type, String name, int topSpeed, int wheels) {
		
		this.type = type;
		this.name = name;
		this.topSpeed = topSpeed;
		this.wheels = wheels;
	}
	
	public void getName() {
		
		System.out.println("The name is " + name);
	}
	
	public void stop() {
		
		System.out.println("Stopping");
		System.out.println("Current speed is 0");
	}
	
}


// CAR CLASS


public class Car extends Vehicle{
	
	private int gears;
	private int doors;

	// Create a generic vehicle, but add on gears and doors
	public Car() {
		
		// super(type, name, topSpeed, wheels);
		this.gears = 10;
		this.doors = 2;
	}
	
	// Create a generic vehicle but replace type, name, topSpeed, wheels, and add gears and doors
	// We use super to pass in arguments FROM the subclass, not to neccessarily INVOKE the superclass
	public Car(String type, String name, int topSpeed, int wheels, int gears, int doors) {

		super(type, name, topSpeed, wheels);
		this.gears = gears;
		this.doors = doors;
		
	}
	
	public void getGears() {
		
		System.out.println("Gears: " + gears);
	}
	
	
	
	
}

```

```Java

// ENEMY CLASS

public class Enemy {
	
	private int health;
	private String weapon;
	private String armor;
	private String type;
	private String name;
	
	public Enemy() {
		
		this.health = 100;
		this.weapon = "Sword";
		this.armor = "Leather";
		this.type = "Warrior";
		this.name = "Bob";
	}
	
	public void setWeapon(String weapon) {
		
		this.weapon = weapon;
	}
	
	public void showWeapon() {
		
		System.out.println("The " + type + " has a " + weapon);
	}
	
	
}

// ORC CLASS

public class Orc extends Enemy {
	
	
		int damageBonus;
	
		public Orc() {
		
			this.damageBonus = 20;
			setWeapon("Mace");
	}
	
	
}

```
