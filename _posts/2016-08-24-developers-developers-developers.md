I feel somewhat accomplished today in that I could have done more, but I'm happy with what I ended up doing.

*Did some Coursera work
*Signed up for an EdX Python course
*Learned some more about git from learngitbranching.js.org
*Found some more awesome resources
*Make more progress on ToP

First up is some Free [e-books](https://www.devbattles.com/en/sand/post-3049-The_Most_Useful_Free_eBooks_for_Web_Developers) I found from a FreeCodeCamp community.  Next, I ended up finding a REALLY helpful post about finding a job in the tech community on [github](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig/blob/master/README.md).  In addition to that I found a pretty laid back [Twitch.tv channel](www.twitch.tv/nashcasts) in addition to a SUPER awesome post about git and how it's used day to day in the life of a developer on [medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/git-cheat-sheet-and-best-practices-c6ce5321f52#.axg5ahh0n).  Finally I think one of the best overall resources that I've found is a 'scenic tour through languages' provided by [learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com).  


Overall, not a bad day at all.  
NOTE: I would say that the github post is on par with the "How to Get a Job at the Big 4" talk given by Sean Lee.  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZCUhxNCv8)
