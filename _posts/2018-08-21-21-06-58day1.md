So today I started figuring out the tactical approach that I want to take towards my classes at WGU, I finally settled on tackling the hardest calss first in each semester/term that I have.  In that same vein I put more time in towards calculus today and got deeper into limits/compound limits.  We'll see what tomorrow brings.
