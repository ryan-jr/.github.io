One of the things I enjoy about CS50 beyond the community, data driven aspects, and integration of multimedia, is the distinction between more/less comfortable tracks.  One of the issues I have with current pedagogy as it's practiced in universities is the largely 'one size fits all' method of lectures/tests etc... but CS50 tries in some regards to get away from that.  

One of the biggest struggles I had was on the less comfortable track with a program to keep track of change, because even with the walkthrough it took me a good 2+ hours to implment properly.  

First I tried to implement a do/while loop incorrectly because I assumed that the while check would happen first (it does not).  I also tried to implement the program using modulo division, which was not my strong suit, and eventually after 45 minutes of trying it went with the much easier to implement version of subtraction via while loops.  The other big thing I had to work around was hitting rounding errors with convering floats to ints which I was able to take care of via round.
