It was another great couple of days for Github Universe this year, and I really
enjoyed it and got to meet a ton of fun and interesting people along the way
in addition to learning some really cool things.  

I think like most conferences/meetups it's a good idea to go in with a game plan
of what you want to get done/accomplished/out of it.  In this case, I didn't get
everything I wanted done, but I feel like I came out really far ahead.   

Some of the highlights of the conference for me:

1.  Getting to learn about Github's social impact
2.  Getting to see Github Actions in action
3.  Meeting a bunch of folks including Chloe, Joe, Hector, Danielle, Tilda, Joan,
    and Linda (sorry if I'm leaving anyone out!).
