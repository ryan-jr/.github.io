So I'm starting with the #100 days of code again and sticking with it this time around.  I've also reached out to Western Governors University after reading [Beau Carnes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-i-got-a-second-degree-and-earned-5-developer-certifications-in-just-one-year-while-working-and-2b902ee291ab) medium post.  

Yesterday I started on the Lynda.com Java programming path, and went back over some of the basics to get back into it.  I'm still a little frustrated that Java is such a strictly/statically typed language, I miss the flexibility of Python, but I strangely enough enjoy the details of Java.
