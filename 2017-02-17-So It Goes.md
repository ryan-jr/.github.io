I finally completed week 3 of MOOC.fi's Java class, and I'm really enjoying it.  I've got about another week before I need to get started on the project that I really want to do for CtCI which is one of the multiple goals/projects that I'm working toward.  Since being on the interview circuit as of late I'm finding that works for me is to transfer things to a physical note pad if I can, or a notepad file, and then at the end of the day transfer it to my whiteboard calander, it just makes my congnitive load that much easier.  I'm also really appreciating using Anki to review code, methods, commands, and other stuff for code.  [This](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-dynamic-framework-for-finding-your-first-programming-job-b4eb0605b4f3#.3jv30g20v) article from Jon Deng is one of the best I've seen when it comes for a mental approach/framework to the job hunt game. All in all a pretty good day.
